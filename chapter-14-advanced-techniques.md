Advanced techniques involve the use of more sophisticated algorithms and data structures that solve problems with higher complexity, optimize performance, or apply unique strategies to specific domains.

### Key Concepts:
- **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: Optimize recursive algorithms by storing previously computed results.
- **Segment Trees**: A tree data structure for storing intervals or segments, allowing fast range queries and updates.
- **Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)**: A data structure that allows efficient querying and updating of cumulative frequency tables.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: A specialized tree used to store associative data structures, particularly strings.

## 📋 Advanced Algorithms

### 1. **Segment Tree for Range Queries**
   Segment trees are powerful tools for solving range queries (like finding minimum or sum in a subarray) and updating array elements efficiently.

   **Key Operations**:
   - Build a segment tree: O(n)
   - Query the tree: O(log n)
   - Update an element: O(log n)

### Python Example:
```python
class SegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.n = len(data)
        self.tree = [0] * (2 * self.n)
        self.build(data)

    def build(self, data):
        # Insert leaf nodes in the tree
        for i in range(self.n):
            self.tree[self.n + i] = data[i]
        # Build the tree by calculating parents
        for i in range(self.n - 1, 0, -1):
            self.tree[i] = self.tree[2 * i] + self.tree[2 * i + 1]

    def update(self, index, value):
        # Update the value at the index
        index += self.n
        self.tree[index] = value
        # Update the parents
        i = index
        while i > 1:
            self.tree[i // 2] = self.tree[i] + self.tree[i ^ 1]
            i //= 2

    def query(self, left, right):
        # Query the sum in the range [left, right]
        left += self.n
        right += self.n
        sum_val = 0
        while left < right:
            if left % 2:
                sum_val += self.tree[left]
                left += 1
            if right % 2:
                right -= 1
                sum_val += self.tree[right]
            left //= 2
            right //= 2
        return sum_val

# Example usage
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
seg_tree = SegmentTree(data)
print("Sum of range (1, 5):", seg_tree.query(1, 5))
seg_tree.update(2, 10)
print("Sum of range (1, 5) after update:", seg_tree.query(1, 5))
```
### 2. *Trie (Prefix Tree)*
A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings and provides fast lookups for prefixes. It’s commonly used in autocomplete, spell-checking, and dictionary implementations.

### Key Operations:
1. Insert a word: O(n)
2. Search for a word: O(n)
3. Search for a prefix: O(n)

### Python Example:
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word

    def starts_with(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True

# Example usage
trie = Trie()
trie.insert("hello")
print(trie.search("hello"))  # True
print(trie.starts_with("hell"))  # True
print(trie.search("hell"))  # False
```
