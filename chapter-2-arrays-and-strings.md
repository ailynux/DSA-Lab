# Chapter 2: Arrays and Strings

Welcome to Chapter 2 of the **Data Structures and Algorithms** repository! In this chapter, we'll explore two fundamental data structures: arrays and strings. Understanding these structures is crucial as they form the basis for more complex data structures and are widely used in coding interviews.


## ðŸ“š What are Arrays?

Arrays are a collection of elements identified by index or key. They store data elements based on an sequential, most commonly 0-based, index. Given their direct access nature, arrays are highly efficient for lookup operations.

### Key Concepts:
- **Element Index**: Each position in an array has a numerical index, which is used to access the element.
- **Homogeneity**: Arrays typically store elements of the same type.
- **Contiguous Memory Allocation**: This means that the memory for each element is allocated side by side in memory.

### Common Operations:
- **Access**: Retrieve an element at a particular index.
- **Insertion**: Adds an element to the array at a specified index.
- **Deletion**: Removes an element from the array.
- **Traversal**: Iterate through each element in the array.
- **Searching**: Find an element in the array.

## ðŸŽ» What are Strings?

Strings are sequences of characters stored in an array-like format. They are used to represent text and consist of consecutive characters, which can be accessed via indexing.

### Key Concepts:
- **Character Array**: Internally, many programming languages implement strings as arrays of characters.
- **Immutability**: In many languages, strings are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be changed.

### Common Operations:
- **Concatenation**: Combining two or more strings.
- **Comparison**: Checking if two strings are identical.
- **Substring**: Extracting parts of a string based on index.
- **Searching**: Finding a character or substring within a string.

### Array Example
```python
# Creating an array
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Accessing elements
print("Accessed Element:", arr[2])

# Inserting element
arr.insert(3, 35)
print("Array after insertion:", arr)

# Deleting element
arr.pop(3)
print("Array after deletion:", arr)
```

### String Example
```python 
# Creating a string
string = "Hello World"

# Accessing character
print("Accessed Character:", string[6])

# Concatenation
new_string = string + "!"
print("Concatenated String:", new_string)

# Substring
substring = string[6:11]
print("Substring:", substring)
```
## ðŸ§  Practice Problems

1. **Reverse Array**: Write a function that reverses an array in place.
2. **Check Permutation**: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
3. **URLify**: Write a method that replaces all spaces in a string with '%20'.

## ðŸ“ˆ Summary

Arrays and strings are the building blocks of many data structures and algorithms. Mastery of these is crucial for effective problem-solving in software development and successful performance in coding interviews.
