- **Explanation of the Data Structure/Algorithm**: Understand its purpose, implementation details, and time/space complexity.
- **Common Patterns and Tricks**: Techniques to apply the concept effectively in different scenarios.
- **Example Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step problem solutions supplemented with visual aids and explanations.
- **Practice Problems**: Curated problems to solidify your understanding and build muscle memory.
- **Bonus Problems**: Optional challenges to further enhance your skills.

### 💼 Additional Resources 
This section contains a variety of tools to help you during and after this repo:

- **Code Templates**: Reusable templates for common patterns. 🧩
- **Cheat Sheets**: Quick references for time and space complexities. 📊
- **Flowcharts**: A decision-making tool to help you choose the right data structure or algorithm. 🗺️
- **Interview Tips**: Insights into coding interview stages with example mock interview videos from FAANG companies. 🎥

### 🚀 Bonus Techniques
In the final section, you'll explore advanced techniques and niche algorithms that are useful but not broad enough to warrant their own chapter.
