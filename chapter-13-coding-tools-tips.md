## üìù Code Templates and Patterns

Here are some common code templates and patterns you can use to quickly solve coding problems in interviews:

### *Sliding Window Template (for Arrays)*
```python
def sliding_window(arr, k):
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    for i in range(len(arr) - k):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i] + arr[i + k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum
```
### *DFS Template (for Trees/Graphs)*
```python
def dfs(node, visited):
    if not node or node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        dfs(neighbor, visited)
```
### *Two Pointer Template*
```python
def two_pointer(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        if arr[left] + arr[right] == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif arr[left] + arr[right] < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
```
## üé• Mock Interview Resources

Mock interviews are crucial for gaining confidence and experience. Here are some resources to help you simulate real-world coding interviews:

1. **Pramp**  
   - **How It Helps**: Free peer-to-peer mock interview platform that connects you with other developers for coding challenges.

2. **Interviewing.io**  
   - **How It Helps**: Offers mock interviews with engineers from top companies and provides feedback on your performance.

3. **LeetCode Mock Interviews**  
   - **How It Helps**: Simulates real interview conditions, allowing you to practice coding problems under time constraints.

## üîß Coding Interview Tips

To succeed in coding interviews, it‚Äôs essential to have the right mindset and approach. Here are some key tips:

1. **Understand the Problem First**  
   Don‚Äôt rush into coding. Take a moment to fully understand the problem, clarify any doubts, and discuss the approach before writing code.

2. **Break the Problem Down**  
   Break the problem into smaller, manageable pieces. Work on solving the base case or an easier version of the problem first.

3. **Optimize After Solving**  
   First, focus on solving the problem, even if it‚Äôs not optimal. Once you have a working solution, think about ways to improve the time and space complexity.

4. **Test Your Code**  
   Always test your code with edge cases and small inputs to ensure correctness before submitting your solution.

5. **Stay Calm and Communicate**  
   If you get stuck, communicate your thought process. Interviewers appreciate hearing how you approach problems, even if you‚Äôre struggling to find the answer.
